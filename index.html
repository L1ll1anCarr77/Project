					 <p>Artificial Intelligence is a tool that is used in different ways.
                     that makes us rethink how we gather information, analyze data, and use the insights to 
                     improve decision making. Alot of people are not familiar with the concept of AI.
                     When 1,500 senior business leaders in the US in 2017 were asked about AI, only
                     17 percent of them said they were familiar.

				  <h1>What is AI?</h1>
			  		<p>It is thought to refer to machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans.According to researchers, Shubhendu and Vijay these software systems made decisions that require a human level of expertise. As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner. AI enables computer machines that stimulate human intelligence and problem solving skills. AI can perform tasks that require human intelligence to work with. Examples of AI we use is GPS guides, autonomous vehicles, and generation tools like Chat GPT. AI also has the ability to process large amounts of data unlike humans. For short, AI is Artificial Intelligence that is used as a tool and has more intelligence than we do.</p>
