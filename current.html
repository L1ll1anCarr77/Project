						<h3 class="h3-current">GPT?</h3>
						<p>GPT stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformers, mostly known as GPT. It uses a transformer architecture and is a big advancement in artificial intelligence, it powers generative AI applications such as Chat GPT. The GPT model gives applications the ability to create text, content, and answer questions in a way that is like a human. Different organizations from certain industries are using GPT for Q&A bots, text summarizing, content generation, and searching. You can use GPT for creating Social Media Content, Converting text to different styles, writing and learning code, analyzing data, producing learning materials, and for building interactive voice assistant.</p>
						
						<h3 class="h3-current">About GPT-3.5/GPT-4</h3>
						<p>GPT 3.5 is a set of models that imporve GPT 3 and can understand and generate natural language or code and GPT 4 is a large multimedia model that can mimic prose, art, video, or audio produced by a human.</p>

			  			<h3 class="h3-current">Data Analytics</h3>
						<p>Data Analytics is the process of analyzing data to find trends and answer questions. It is broad across the field. This process has many different techniques and goals that can differ from each industry. Data Analytics process has parts that can help a variety of enterprises.</p>
						<p>Another part of Data analytics is descriptive analytics. This is the process of describing historical trends and summarizing data. Data Analysis is also growing and. estimated 900 million users will be added by the year 2025. Data analytics has transformed the way organizations extract data from vast data sets.</p>

			  		   <h3 class="h3-current"> Explainable AI</h3>
					   <p>Explainable AI is a set of tools to help you understand and interpret predictions made by your machine learning models.</p>
					   <p>This had started to develop when researchers began to make AI more transparent and interpretable. It aims to provide insights into how AI models arrive at specific decisions, making it easier for people to trust and understand AI-generated outcomes.</p>

						<h3 class="h3-current">What is natural language processing?</h3>
						<p>Natural Language Processing dates back to the 1950s, when researchers had made their first attempts to teach computers to understand and generate human language. Deep learning revolutionized NLP with models such as GPT and BERT. These models have achieved state of the art results in a variety of NLP tasks. It also has went global, with bilingual models such as XLM-R and mBERT which are capable of generating text and understanding different language.</p>

			  			<h3 class="h3-current">Generative Adversarial Networks</h3>
						<p>This is an invention of Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues, introduced in 2014. The idea was to pit two neural networks against each other in a competitive framework: a generator network and a discriminator network. It had also grown in complexity over time. The size of the model has been growing. </p>
